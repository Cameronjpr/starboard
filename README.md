# starboard
A simple game about trading, sailing, and the distant past.

# background
In Starboard, you play as a merchant trading their way across the ancient Mediterranean. Your job is to sail between islands, buying and selling precious resources, and avoiding deadly storms. Try to amass as much gold as possible -- before your inevitable watery death. 

# how to play - controls
Use the arrow keys to control your ship. 
Press H to bring up the help screen
Press Q to dump your cargo into the sea

# how to play - strategy
Your Cargo and Gold are displayed at the top of the screen. 

Approaching an island will dock your ship at that island. From there, you can purchase the resource produced by that island (if you ahve the money!). The amount you pay is dependent on the island's current Selling Price. This changes each game and each time you die.

With cargo on board, make your way to an island that wants what you're carrying. Islands that want your cargo are marked with a target. Dock your ship at one of these islands and you will have the option to sell your cargo to them for a profit. The amount received depends on the island's current Buying Price (which works the same as the selling price). 

Avoid storms, as they will do damage. Every time you hit one, you lose gold, health (HP), and all of your cargo.



# tips
Jewellery is the most valuable resource in the game. You can make up to 50 Gold by trading it between islands.
Storms can't pass over islands -- putting an island between you and the right-edge of the map will keep you safe from storms. 
Sometimes you can pick up cargo that no islands wants to buy -- this is a known bug. Press Q to dump your cargo if this happens to you.

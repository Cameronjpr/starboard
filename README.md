# starboard
A 2D game about boats, ports, and the distant past.

# background
In Starboard, you play as a merchant trading their way across the ancient Mediterranean. Your job is to sail between islands, buying and selling precious resources. Try to amass as much gold as possible -- before your inevitable watery death. 

# how to play
Use the arrow keys to control your ship. 
Your Cargo type and Gold are displayed at the top of the map. 

Approaching an island will fill up your cargo hold with the resource it produces. You pay gold for the resource -- the amount depends on what the island's current Selling Price is.

With cargo on board, make your way to an island that Wants what you're carrying. Approaching this island will deplete your cargo, gaining you gold. The amount here depends on the recipient island's Buying Price.
